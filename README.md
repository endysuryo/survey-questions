## 📦 Choice of Package

### - Tailwind CSS

- **Purpose :** to replace semantic CSS.
- **Benefits :** fast development without writing any CSS.
- **Underlying :** writing semantic CSS takes more time when we do development, so I am trying to get an alternate package to replace semantic CSS to speed up development and make it easy to maintain.

### - Material UI

- **Purpose :** generate common components like form, alert, and icons.
- **Benefits :** we can use consist components with same style and re-useable in another parent components.
- **Underlying :** to build custom form components that are easy to use and maintain.

### - Formik

- **Purpose :** form hooks to handling form values, validation and submission.
- **Benefits :** Formik allows you to define your form using a declarative syntax, which makes it easy to understand and maintain. You simply define your form fields, validation rules, and submission handler, and Formik takes care of the rest..
- **Underlying :** to handle form submission in a centralized and easy-to-use way.
